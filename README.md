From the [Yarn repo documentation](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn):
> Fast: Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download the same package again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.

Having that in mind and inspiried by Kent C. Dodds' [mention of the idea](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/788420794984521729), Merino will allow you to prime your cache with a single module.

##### Install
```
 yarn add merino && yarn remove merino
```
